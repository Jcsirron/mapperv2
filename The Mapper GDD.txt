[The Mapper]:

Primary gameplay loop:
 explore world with survival mechanics (wildlife, hunger, thirst)
 note points of interest (wildlife, plants, towns, etc.)
 return to town
 
Secondary gameplay loop:
 person requests path to something
 if player does not have the requested something, they must undertake an expedition to find it or reject "job"
 player gives path to person
 if path is accurate and person returns, reputation increases
 if path is not accurate, person does not return, ruining opportunity for further jobs
 if no more people in town, player loses
 
Tertiary gameplay loop:
 maps become inaccurate over time and must be re-surveyed
 some people will not benefit the town/become a problem for the player and can be dealt with by sending them to a "bad" location
 player's actions will shape where other settlements spring up and the prosperity of their town
  - other settlements can become sources for other missions
  
The Pitch:
You are a cartographer that has arrived at a small frontier town in need of your services.  Problem is, you haven't mapped the area yet.  You need to set out on expeditions to map areas of interest, making sure that you bring enough supplies to survive the wilderness.  With your hard-earned information, you can then help the town get the supplies needed to thrive.  Be careful to not put yourself out of business, however.  A townsperson with a whole map won't need to come back to you for your services again.  You have bills to pay, after all.

[The Mapper] is a top down exploration game where the player must manually create a world map and sell portions of it to to make ends meet.  The cartographer's office needs to be maintained and the player needs to be fed, creating the tension of getting people to their goal while not giving too much away where the people no longer need the player.

The Art Style:
The game will be split into two different portions:  The meat-space and the map-space.
The meat-space is where the player navigates their character in the world and goes about exploring the areas around the town.  The artwork for this section will be something similar to Stardew Valley or A Link to the Past.
The map-space is somewhat abstracted, where the player places things that they find in a given tile.  The artwork for this section is going to be simplified as compared to the meat-space, with artwork in the same vein as Advance Wars or Link's Awakening.

Coding layout:

each tile is created on a 1.5 scale of the window to make it harder for the player to calculate.
Home tile is [0, 0] and the player can navigate in all directions from the home tile.  The additional tiles are generated when the player enters a tile adjacent to the edge.  Worst case scenario is the game generating three additional tiles.
