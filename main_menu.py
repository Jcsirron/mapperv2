# TODO: Create the main menu for the game
# This will have to have the following:
# Play - Navigate to the game in main.py (may need to be refactored to game.py
# Credits - Navigate to the credits menu (will need to be created as well)
# Quit - Quit the program (obviously)
# Disclaimer - This may be a sub-menu that pops up when started.
# The disclaimer will say, "This is an initial prototype for The Mapper (working title).  As such, there will be bugs
# and unexpected behavior.  I need your feedback to make this game better!  If you see something, reach out and let me
# know, either on Twitter (@jcsirron) or e-mail (jcsirron@gmail.com).
